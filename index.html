		<!-- Add a personal bio below -->
		<p>
			Artist Statement : Born in Macau and currently based in California, I am a multidisciplinary artist working across painting, clay, and mixed media. With a background in social work and cultural studies, my practice explores personal identity, ideology, and myth, blending subjective narratives with raw expression. Art, to me- is an ongoing journey into the unknown, a space to reflect, transform, and discover meaning through creation.
